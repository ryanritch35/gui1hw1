For this I really enjoyed the websites and the video that the professor provided. The first thing I did was go into the roadmap website where you can select different careers and then find out a roadmap of how to become that type of developer or programmer. The front end developer roadmap is where I spent most of my time since that is the area I was most interested in. They talked about the different languages or skills that someone who wanted to become a front end developer would need. Next I watched the video. It was really long so I was not able to finish this week but I will try to! The guy in the video talks about how css and html is the base for all websites and really emphasized on how css is difficult and every coder should spend a little time using css. He talks about how laying out your page is really important and how the set up for the page is just as important as the content itself. Then I read the guide on how to become a developed article where the author talks about how different languages are laid out and are important to the idea of a front end developer. All in all I learned how there’s a really important base that is necessary to front end or web developers that are vital to everything. These are all emphasized in all the videos and articles that the professor provided. s
